# PDF Data Extraction from URL

This project extracts data from PDF reports available on a specific webpage. The main goal is to download and extract relevant data from PDFs that contain the keywords "DSM", "SRAS", "TRAS", "SCUC" in their titles and then filter the extracted data based on specific criteria (e.g., the presence of the keyword "MPL").
